  <h1>Privacy Policy for CalculateMate</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: June 6, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for using CalculateMate (“the App”), published by MatesApp. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information (if any) the App collects, how it is used, and the measures we take to safeguard your data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    CalculateMate is a simple, offline calculator application. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data, usage analytics, or device identifiers. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> The App does not ask for, request, or store any personal details such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</li>
    <li><strong>No Usage Analytics:</strong> The App does not integrate any analytics or tracking SDKs (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase, or similar). It does not record user actions, screen views, or error logs.</li>
    <li><strong>No Third-Party Data Sharing:</strong> Because we do not collect any data, there is nothing to share with third parties, advertisers, or marketing partners.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    CalculateMate does not request or require any special Android permissions (e.g., camera, contacts, storage, location). All functionality runs entirely on the device without accessing external services or sensors.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    Since the App does not communicate with remote servers or record analytics, we do not collect or store any log data (such as crash reports, network logs, or device status). Any crash or debug information that might appear on your device is handled solely by the Android system; it is not transmitted, stored, or accessible by CalculateMate.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    CalculateMate does not use cookies, local storage, or any other mechanism to store information in the App’s context. All computations and button-press data exist only in memory while the App is open; nothing is written to outside storage.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    CalculateMate does not embed, link to, or invoke any third-party SDKs, libraries, or advertising networks. In particular:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Advertising SDKs:</strong> You will not see ads or sponsored content within the App.</li>
    <li><strong>No Analytics or Crash-Reporting SDKs:</strong> We do not use Firebase, Crashlytics, Google Analytics, or similar services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Although we do not collect or transmit any user data, we still take basic measures to ensure that the App you install is authentic and safe:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App is signed with our official developer key before publishing on Google Play.</li>
    <li>All network access (e.g., Play Store download) is encrypted via HTTPS.</li>
    <li>We follow standard Android best practices for coding and packaging to avoid malware or tampering.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    CalculateMate is suitable for all ages. Because we do not collect any data or require sign-in, there are no privacy concerns specific to minors. If a child installs and uses the App, no personal information is gathered or stored.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Because CalculateMate does not collect any data, we do not anticipate significant changes to this policy. However, if our data practices ever change (for example, if we introduce a new feature that requires data collection), we will update this Privacy Policy and post the new revision here. We recommend checking this page periodically for the latest information.
  </p>
